<h1>Client plugin</h1>
KBEngine is an open source game server engine that does not include the 
complete client part, but we provide a client plug-in part that can quickly 
interface with the server. The client plug-in contains communication with 
the server, registration account, login interface, Entity base class, and 
so on. The plug-in and the client UI layer interact with each other. 
The plug-in provides the UI layer data for display (eg, HP changes, the 
entities entering the clients View), and the UI provides the plug-in layer 
with updates based on the clients input. 
(e.g., the position and orientation of the character)
<br>
<br>

KBEngine implements different client plug-ins under different front-end 
technologies, but each plug-in follows the methods and attributes listed 
in this API document, and an implementation standard is available for 
different client plug-ins in the documentation.
